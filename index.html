      She's smilin' like she used to smile way back then
      She's feelin' like she used to feel way back when
      They tried, but somethin' kept them
      Waiting for this magic moment
    
      Maybe this time
      It'll be lovin' they'll find
      Maybe now they can be more than just friends
      She's back in his life
      And it feels so right
      Maybe this time...
    
      Maybe this time
      Maybe this time love won't end
